        <h2>When I was little</h2>
        <p>
          I even can't remember when this picture was taken! I must be under 5. It was such a long time ago. I was wearing my favourite dress and carrying my favourite red little unbrella. I was super happy at the time.

        <h2>Highschooler Yolanda</h2>
        <p>
          This picture was taken at my high school graduation ceremony. I was 18 at that time. I finished high school in Bay Area and left many sweet memories there. I miss my high school grils very much!

        <p>
          This is me recently. I took this picture with my best friend Eunice at Giesel library in UCSD. It was her birthday that day. We went out to have dinner in the evening.
