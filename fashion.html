          <img src = "milktea.jpg" alt = "milktea">
          <p>Winter is always a time when warm colors are in. The most popular color this winter is definitely milk tea. Many have launched milktea colored lipsticks. Among them, my favorite is Estee Lauder's milk tea lipstick, it is moist and natural.</p>

          <p>This winter we refuse heavy fragrance! The most popular drink this year is probably white peach oolong tea. Using a peach fragrance in winter is refreshing and sweet.</p>

          <p>The most important characteristic of cashmere sweaters is their softness. They can be worn close to the body. A warm and soft sweater is much needed in winter.</p>

                <p>Dior Lip Glow with fresh color and moisturizing cream is a product I use all year round. It has a natural color and lip protection effect. I carry it with me almost every day. I love a high-impact lip color, but in the winter, my thirsty lips aren't always up for supporting a heavy matte lipstick. Pigmented lip balm sounds like a great alternative. The lip glow applied super smoothly and, after a couple coats, gave my lips a pop of color a bit pinker and brighter than natural. I'm prone to chapped lips, so I appreciated how moisturizing the formula was while still delivering colorâ€”a great alternative to a lipstick. The color was buildable but still resulted in a finish somewhere between a gloss and a lipstick.
